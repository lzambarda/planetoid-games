# Planetoid Games
From time to time I am asked if I still have the games from the Planetoid series.
The purpose of this repo is to gather all executables and maybe even source code in case anyone is interested.

### Planetoid 3D
Somewhere I also have the source code of Planetoid 3D. The problem with it is that it was done with XNA which is not supported nor maintained anymore. [MonoGame](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame) is a great project trying to fill the gap. I did some work on the original Planetoid 3D code to try and make it work again, however it is not working yet.

### Running on macOS
I managed to run The Planetoid and Planetoid 2 with no major issues using CrossOver (sometimes the sound was not playing though). Planetoid 3 - Alpha seems to not load correctly and I suspect it has to do with the sound engine. Anyway that game was quite unstable!
